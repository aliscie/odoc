Our mission is to decentralize freelance contracts, making them transparent and liberating through the power of smart contracts. We envision a platform that provides unparalleled freedom and trust for freelancers."

        title: "Profile trust score",

This fosters a highly transparent environment, empowering both freelancers and clients by encouraging trust and accountability throughout the process. For example, if a user canceled a contract, it will appear in their profile."

This ensures that organizations like hospitals and research teams can confidently use our app. Initially, we offer simple functionalities like spreadsheets, text styling, and grammar correction. Users can choose to upload data to the blockchain for added security, with local storage capabilities. Our permission system based on internet identity enhances privacy and data access control."

Also, with plugins, you can implement custom formulas like a Google translator. Last but not least, you can use these spreadsheets as a user_canister for your services. In other words, the components will act as a frontend that interacts with this spreadsheet."
