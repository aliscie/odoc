## old version of Odoc can be found [here](https://github.com/aliscie/Odoc-old)

## to get started
1. first download the pocketic https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic/releases
2. add this to dfx.json
   ```json
   "internet_identity": {
   "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity.did",
   "remote": {
   "id": {
   "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
   }
   },
   "type": "custom",
   "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm.gz"
   },
   ```

3. in your .env file add
    1. When you run `dfx deploy` you will get 3 links, frontend, backend and internet_identity copy the value with localhost and the port after it
    2. `VITE_IC_HOST='http://localhost:<the port of your host canisters eg localhost:4943 or 127.0.0.1:5000 etc>`
    3. `VITE_INTERNET_IDENTITY=<internet_identity id at the end of link after ?id=.....>`
    4. `POCKET_IC_BIN=/<path to>/pocket-ic`
    5. `BACKEND_WASM=/<ur dir>/odoc/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm`
    6. `VITE_DFX_NETWORK='local'`
    7. `VITE_DFX_PORT=<the port from dfx deploy urls>`
   
4. read this https://crates.io/crates/pocket-ic
5. and read this https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hadronous/pic

## TO get started

1. `dfx start --background --clean`
2. `dfx deploy`
3. `dfx deploy generate`
4. `yarn start`
5. open http://127.0.0.1:5173/

Odoc

This app is Notion.so clone, roam research clone and obsidian clone. The main purpose of this app is not to just clone
these note-taking apps but to make an all-in-one **Open source note-taking app** with automation features.

## features:

1. **Plugins** : plugins or extensions are customizations that you can add to your Odoc application. For example, you
   can add grammar correction plugin like grammarly, or a machine learning plugin that help you abbreviation your text.
2. **Components** : In notion you may notice that you can import a table when you hit `/` then type table then hit
   enter. The table called a component. In Odoc you can create your own custom components. For example, you can create
   flash cards. Also, you can use plugins to enhance your components. For example, you can use Google translator plugin
   with flash card component so everytime you add a word you will get automatic translation.
3. **Services** : The is the core goal of Odoc where you can create a Google translator plugin and create flashcard
   components then put them all in one workspace (page) and you can publish that page so other people can use it. In
   other word you don't need to create new plugin and component for every user, instead one user can create all of them
   and share it with others.
4. **search** : We will have 6 search functionaries.
    - search for words in file
    - search for files names
    - global search for words in any files in any directory you choose
    - regular expression search.
    - save your search results and reuse them again.

5. **spreadsheet** : similar to Microsoft Excel you will have a spreadsheet where you can store your data and implement
   formulas. Also, with plugins you can implement custom formulas like a Google translator. Last but not least, you can
   use these spreadsheets as a backend for your services. In other word the components will act as a frontend that
   interact with this spreadsheet.

- Features:
    - **Columns permissions**: You can decide who can see, update each column or comment on a column
    - **Views permission**: You can decide who can see each view. Also, the views permission called rows permission
      because you can add a file for a view to event specific users from sewing septic rows. And this filter can't be
      removed by anyone so others can only add more filters but can't touch your filter.
    - **Custom smart contract**: you can write somthing
      like `if (approved = true) {transfer(100$).to(columns.assigned)}` this will automatically release the payment of a
      ser when you approve the delivery of an item.

1. **Ownership** : when you create a component, or a plugin or a service you will own it as an NFT. Hence, you can make
   money from it. There are three ways to make money with NFTs. One by selling it. Second, by getting percentage on
   every sell. Third, by requiring subscriptions fees like 7$ a month without selling the plugin or the service.

2. **Privacy** : You will have the option to upload your data on the blockchain internet computer in order to share it
   with other people.

## Benefits and vision

- First of all, I believe this new system will replace Microsoft Office and apple iwork.
- Users, will have safe place to store their data on the blockchain on IC.
- Users can do whatever they can imagine with all these customizations.
- there are more feature that I will work one like Real time data, so you can share your documents and update them in
  real time. or like page components. So, you can have an entire page as a spreadsheet.
- Success: I believe Odoc will be successful because the market is already huge, if I just take all docs apps like
  events, microsoft words and notion then I put all of their features in one place, of course I will get at least few
  users.
- Disability: Because I am using rust and wasm everything became durable and easy, even the code editor. With `rust` I
  can execute any program langauge seamlessly.
- I also ran few **experiment** before building this project in order to reach to the ultimate way.
